Careless,Sue Thomson,2025,88 mins,Documentary,"Australian, Documentaries, The Body Is a Battlefield","In a country where ageing has become a business, this funny, moving documentary follows elderly people’s fight to grow old their way.","When director Sue Thomson’s 89-year-old mum, Margaret, begins to need additional help with day-to-day life, they face a decision that most families will encounter: whether to consider a residential aged-care facility; and, if so, how to find a suitable one amid a sector with a reputation for neglect and mistreatment. Margaret’s story becomes a springboard for an investigation of the political history of aged care in Australia, marred by a 40-year bipartisan privatisation agenda. As we hear from advocates, journalists and senior citizens who have experienced the system, a group of schoolkids discuss the situation we’ve reached with aged care and where we need to go from here – and of what they, and we, can expect in the future.",English,24 Aug,Kino 1,1:15pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/careless

Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman,Chantal Akerman,1996,63 mins,Documentary,Chantal Akerman: Traces,This auto-portrait made for French TV offers a rare first-person insight into the director’s life and artistic process.,"When approached by co-producers Janine Bazin and André S. Labarthe to make an episode for their long-running French TV documentary seriesCinéastes de notre temps, Chantal Akerman found that all her suggestions for directors to profile had already been taken. So, instead, she turned the lens on herself, choosing to address the camera in a casual setting at home – seated in a fold-up chair, her dog padding around nearby – and read a letter about her work, supported by clips drawn from a vast spectrum of her filmography.",French,18 Aug,ACMI 2,3:45pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/chantal-akerman-par-chantal-akerman

Through webcam chats, conversations at the kitchen table and shots of lonely landscapes, Akerman constructs a touching, melancholy portrait of her mother, as well as of her own impending grief.",French,24 Aug,ACMI 1,3:30pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/no-home-movie

Stronger on vibes than actual investigative journalism skills, they soon realise they’ve gone to the wrong small town; and, rather than opening their eyes to the health crises affecting the local community who hesitantly let them in, decide to stick around and make up a viral story instead.","English, Spanish",16 Aug,Hoyts 11,6:30pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/magic-farm

Rather than examine the crime from a forensic perspective, Akerman probes the knotty soul of this American community: interviewing family members and local law enforcement; attending Byrd’s memorial; and, in one idiosyncratic section, filming a long tracking shot along the road on which Byrd was killed.",English,19 Aug,Kino 2,6:15pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/sud

Hotel Monterey,Chantal Akerman,1972,63 mins,"Documentary, Experimental",Chantal Akerman: Traces,Akerman’s debut feature silently captures a mesmeric night of down-at-heel accommodation in 70s Manhattan.,"Shot over the course of an evening in an Upper West Side welfare hotel where the director had occasionally stayed, Chantal Akerman’s first foray into true durational filmmaking is a striking start to a singular career. Without narration, the camera takes in the various rooms and levels of the establishment, beginning in the lobby and ending on the roof. Captured through mostly static shots and slow pans, scenes of quiet corridors are occasionally disrupted by residents as they either attempt to navigate the camera’s intrusion into their private space or ignore it wholly. As time slowly passes, the viewer is invited to pay attention to the small details: a wall colour; a patron’s bow tie; a reflection in the mirror.",No Dialogue,15 Aug,ACMI 2,6:00pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/hotel-monterey

This is particularly the case in states like Texas, Florida and Louisiana, where conservative local and state governments frequently request for books – classic novels, young adult fiction and vital educational resources alike – to be banned from circulation. The only ones standing in their way are the librarians. Fiercely committed to the importance of reading, these ordinary people devoted to serving their communities found action groups, spearhead legislative activism or simply refuse to remove books with LGBTQIA+ themes, potentially facing harassment, violence and public dismissal in the process.",English,18 Aug,ACMI 1,3:30pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/the-librarians
The Librarians,Kim A. Snyder,2025,92 mins,Documentary,Documentaries,"This rousing documentary ventures into the maelstrom of the US war on books, finding the passionate bibliophiles fighting censorship on the frontlines.","At a time when US democracy is under threat, libraries are bulwarks of freedom of information. This is particularly the case in states like Texas, Florida and Louisiana, where conservative local and state governments frequently request for books – classic novels, young adult fiction and vital educational resources alike – to be banned from circulation. The only ones standing in their way are the librarians.

I asked myself if the future is always in front of us. So I looked ahead; then I turned around.” As her narration progresses, her words are spoken with increasing speed, keeping pace with the camera – which, as it rotates, exposes her apartment to the viewer with the director only occasionally in frame.",French,20 Aug,Kino 2,6:30pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/le-jour-ou

Love,Dag Johan Haugerud,2024,119 mins,Drama,Europe & UK,While travelling by ferry – a popular cruising destination in more ways than one – a commitment-shy doctor has a life-changing brush with contemporary hook-up culture.,"Marianne (Andrea Bræin Hovig, in a Gothenburg Film Festival award-winning performance) is a urologist at an Oslo hospital, tasked with delivering prostate cancer diagnoses to male patients. Reluctant to seek out any serious relationships, she lets her friend fix her up with a date on the nearby peninsula of Nesodden, just a short ferry ride away. When she meets work colleague Tor en route and he confides that he uses the cruise as a hotspot for Grindr hook-ups, Marianne begins to wonder if a random sexual encounter of her own might be a way to bring some frisson to her life, and to distract from the spectre of death that looms over her day job. But as she and Tor each discover, nothing is ever simple in the realm of sexual intimacy.",Norwegian,23 Aug,Kino 2,4:00pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/love

By Design,Amanda Kramer,2025,91 mins,"Drama, Comedy",North America,"In this absurdist satire from maverick indie filmmaker Amanda Kramer, a woman is magically transformed into a chair – and discovers that everyone likes her better that way.","On an antique-shopping expedition with bitchy friends, lonely and dissatisfied Camille (Juliette Lewis) is gripped by envy at the sight of a particularly sublime chair: “its beauty, its usefulness, its deserving of praise”. Her yearning is literalised when she swaps bodies with the piece of furniture, inhabiting its unmoving wooden structure as her human body turns lifeless, motionless –chair-like. While her friends and mother love this new silent and compliant Camille, the chair ends up in the possession of heartbroken Olivier (Mamoudou Athie), who grows increasingly enchanted by it. Is Olivier merely in love with the chair’s gorgeous design, or is he falling for the trapped soul of Camille?",English,10 Aug,Hoyts 8/10,6:30pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/by-design

Ghost Boy,Rodney Ascher,2025,91 mins,Documentary,"MIFF Online, The Body Is a Battlefield","A SXSW award-winning documentary about one man whose body became a prison, and how he found a way out.","Martin Pistorius, an electronics-loving 12-year-old growing up in Johannesburg, came home one day with a sore throat. But what seemed like a run-of-the-mill bug was the precursor to a living nightmare: locked-in syndrome, a neurological condition in which a person is fully aware of their surroundings but unable to move or communicate. Pistorius would go on to spend more than a decade in a presumed vegetative state in a care home where he encountered horrible mistreatment, until one valiant carer realised that he was conscious – and could tell the world what he’d been through.",English,24 Aug,MIFF Online (Streaming),11:00pm,https://miff.com.au/program/film/ghost-boy
